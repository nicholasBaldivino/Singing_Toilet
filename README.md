# Toto-Toilet-14-
A toilet that plays Africa by Toto when you flush
Uses C# to access a sound file from the computer. Enter the directory for a .wav file in place of "C:\Users\nickb\OneDrive\Desktop\ontivacom-africa-hq_2Hkp3AvD.wav"
Connect the a switch to the arduino that is activated by the plunger arm moving into the flush position.
Once it is hit, it sends a command via the serial port to the C# program to start playing music.
