# Toto-Toilet-14-
A toilet that plays Africa by Toto when you flush
Uses C# to access a sound file from the computer. Has the arduino connected to a switch that is activated by the plunger arm on the toilet. When the arm
is hit, it sends a command via the serial port to the C# program to start playing music.
